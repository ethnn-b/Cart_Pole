# CART POLE PROJECT FOR SCI-TECH MENTORSHIP
This GitHub repository contains the implementation of the Q-Learning (Reinforcement) learning algorithm in Python. The codes are tested in the Cart Pole OpenAI Gym (Gymnasium) environment. The tutorial webpage explaining the posted codes is given here:

https://aleksandarhaber.com/q-learning-in-python-with-tests-in-cart-pole-openai-gym-environment-reinforcement-learning-tutorial/

The purpose of creating this repository is to get familiar with GitHub (as the code is the same I have tested from the videos).

The files in the repository are:

"Beginner Cart_pole Code.py" - Find here the beginner-level code on how to set up the cart pole environment and its constraints

"Main Final Code - Credits - AleksanderHaber.py" - This file contains the Q-learning algorithm. This code file imports a class called "Q_Learning" that is developed in "Q learning Class definiton.py"

"Q learning Class definiton.py" -  The class "Q_Learning" defined in this file implements the Q learning algorithm.
